                <p>My name is Ismayil Rahimov, and I am a Computer Engineering student at ADA University. I am passionate about understanding how technology works, from hardware components to modern software tools. I enjoy practicing with small projects that help me grow both technically and creatively.</p>
                <p>I actively learn tools such as HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub, and I enjoy exploring how hardware and software connect to create complete systems. I also value teamwork — one of my favorite group tasks was building basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT to understand how computers process information.</p>
